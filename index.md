I am the Commander G.E. Boone Endowed Professor of Computational Sciences in the department of [Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/academics/math/faculty.aspx) at [Monmouth College](http://www.monmouthcollege.edu). I hold a Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Cincinnati](http://www.uc.edu) and do research in quantum computation with a focus on the development of programming tools aimed at making near-term quantum devices available and accessible to software developers. See my [CV](/cv/) for all the gory details.
