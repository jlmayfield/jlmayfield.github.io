I'm currently working on the development of programming tools for quantum computation. Past, present, and future projects in this area are maintained under the [QC at MC](https://github.com/QCatMC) open-source development group. My latest project is an open source GNU Octave package called Quantum Circuit Sandbox (qcs) for working with quantum circuits. For more information see the project's website here: [Quantum Circuit Sandbox](https://qcatmc.github.io/quantumCircuitSandbox/).  

For a complete list of my publications see my [CV](/cv/)
