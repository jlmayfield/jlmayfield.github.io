I'm currently working on two projects. The first is an open source GNU Octave package called Quantum Circuit Sandbox (qcs) for working with quantum circuits. For more information see the project's website here: [Quantum Circuit Sandbox](https://jlmayfield.github.io/quantumCircuitSandbox/).  

My other project is an authorship attribution study for a Monmouth College colleague in the History department.  Check back soon for links to pre-print drafts of the results.

For a complete list of my publications see my [CV](/cv/)
