## Problem Sets

You are expected to begin reading the chapters and working the problem sets prior to starting the material in class. Be prepared to provide an answer to a problem set problem when called on.  Grades for problem sets will be a combination of your preparedness in class and the completeness of the set when handed in. Class time will focus on discussion and clarification of more involved topics.
