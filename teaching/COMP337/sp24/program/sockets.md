[Get the assignment starter from github](https://classroom.github.com/a/9N__bdUj)

There are three socket programming exercises for you to do:

1. [Web Server Program](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/programming/Python_code_only/WebServer_programming_lab_only.pdf)
2. Simple web client. This is the second optional program on the web server program (above). You do not need to make it a command-line program. That being said, this is an excellent change to learn/reinforce how to build command-line tools in python. Check out [this article from the Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments).  
3. [UDP Pinger Program](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/programming/Python_code_only/UDP_Pinger_programming_lab_only.pdf) 


Any other optional programming assignment on the above two pdf is, in fact, optional.
