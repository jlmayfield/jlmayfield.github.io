There are two socket programming exercises for you to do:

1. [Web Server Program](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/programming/Python_code_only/WebServer_programming_lab_only.pdf)
    * **You must do the second optional program as well**, but do not need to make it a command-line program. That being said, this is an excellent change to learn/reinforce how to build command-line tools in python. Check out [this article from the Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments).  
2. [UDP Pinger Program](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/programming/Python_code_only/UDP_Pinger_programming_lab_only.pdf) 
    * All optional programs are, in fact, optional.
