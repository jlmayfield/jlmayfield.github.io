You need to complete the following two Wireshark assignments: 
*   [HTTP Wireshark](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/Wireshark_HTTP_v8.0.pdf)
*   [DNS Wireshark](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/Wireshark_DNS_v8.0.pdf)

Generally follow the lab directions given in the above PDFs, but:
1.  Make PDFs of the requested/required packets. Do you best to include only the packets relevant to the task and only the relevant parts of the header. Multiple PDFs are OK. 
2.  Answer all the questions in a raw text (.txt extension) or [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) document (.md). This will make it easy to read them on the github assignment. *Put all your written responses in a single document. Label each response.*
3. Push all packet captures PDFs and your responses to the Wireshark Dropbox on github classroom. 

**You may be called to present and explain your responses to the lab questions.**
