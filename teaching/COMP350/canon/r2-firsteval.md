## Reflection \#2 - Your First Self-Evaluation

We now turn to the business of carrying out a critical self-evaluation of your learning.  The goal for this reflection is to get feedback on your self-assessment.  You'll need to *bring your reading journal* to the meeting along with your repsonse to the questions below. 

#### What to Write

*In one to two pages, respond to the questions below. Be sure to submit your report card along with the letter*

1. While there is a lot to be learned from the content of the papers we're reading, part of what you're developing in this class are the skills and experience needed to engage with research papers and other primary sources of our discipline.  How has your approach to reading papers changed as the course has progressed? Of the papers we've read, which have helped you develop most as a reader and why?  
2. Looking at this class in a vacuum, how's it going so far? Any concerns you want to discuss? Anything you're particularly happy with? 
3. Putting this class in the context of your schedule and the rest of your life, are you able to balance the demands of this course along with the rest of your schedule and life so far? Where does this class fall on your list of priorities? Are there any external pressures affecting your work that you want me to be aware of?
