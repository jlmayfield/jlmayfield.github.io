You'll be working problems from chapter 8 today. 

* Don't forget that at the end of each chapter contains a *Programming Summary* section that provides a quick dictionary of all of the important function and encoding names introduced thus far. When you run into problems don't forget to check the *Common Bugs* and *Debugging Tips* scattered throughout the chapters as well. If you're stuck on an error try looking at these items.
* As always switch the *driver* (person typing the code) and *navigator* (person watching, helping spot typos, etc.) on every new problem **or** every half hour, whichever comes first.
* Do all of the problems in a single python file. Put everyone's name in a comment at the top of the file. Label the start of each problem with a comment.

### To Do

Complete the following exercises from chapter 8:
* 8.1
* 8.2 **but** *in order to practice index notation use Program 101 rather than program 100*
* 8.3 (you can choose to work with program 101 again if you wish)
* 8.5
* 8.7
