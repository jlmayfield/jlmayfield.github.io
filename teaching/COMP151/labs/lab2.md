For your second lab you'll be working on the basics of image manipulation a la Sections 4.2 and 4.3. Don't forget that at the end of chapters 2 and 4 there are a *Programming Summary* sections that provides a quick dictionary of all of the important function and encoding names introduced thus far. When you run into problems don't forget to check the *Common Bugs* and *Debugging Tips* scattered throughout the chapters as well.

From Chapter 4 do the following problems: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.24, and 4.25.
* As always switch the *driver* (person typing the code) and *navigator* (person watching, helping spot typos, etc.) on every new problem.
* Do all of the problems in a single python file. Put everyone's name in a comment at the top of the file. Label the start of each problem with a comment.
* For any problem that includes responding to questions as well as interacting with python code, write your responses as a comment. along with the required code.  
* Build a habit of testing now (see 4.3.3). Test everything your write. Verify that the color values change the way you expect them to change.

 When you're done or when time is up, whichever comes first, print your code and hand it in.  You might also want to email a copy of your document to the group so everyone has it. If you did not finish the problems, it will not hurt your grade. You are encouraged to work them out before class Wednesday, but are not required to do so.
