Until the curriculum change for Fall of 2019, COMP161 acted as a transitional course.
It took students from the functional style of [COMP160](/teaching/COMP160/) to the
more imperative, object-oriented style of [COMP220](/teaching/COMP220/). In it's
final form, students were also introduced to Python in preparation for the new
Python-based introductory sequence.
