Until a curriculum change in Fall 2019, COMP161 acted as a transitional course.
It took students from the functional style of [COMP160](/teaching/COMP160/) to the
more imperative, object-oriented style of COMP220. In it's
final form, students were also introduced to Python in preparation for the new
Python-based introductory sequence.
