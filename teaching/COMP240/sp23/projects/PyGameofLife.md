## Requirements

  1. Players have a start/stop button that starts and stops the cell evolution.
  2. The game will track and display the age of the current generation of cells (i.e. number of iterations since start was pressed and during which the player did not manually modify a cell.)
  3. Clicking on the game grid while the game is stopped will flip the status of the cell that is clicked and will reset the the generation age to zero.
  4. At least one additional game feature is added to the above specifications.
  5. The program is implemented using Object-Oriented Python and generally adheres to a Model-View-Controller design.
