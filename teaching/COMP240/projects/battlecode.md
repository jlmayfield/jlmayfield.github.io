For our first project we'll be taking a crack at [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/), specifically the [2022 Variation](https://play.battlecode.org/home). Battlecode is an annual programming tournament hosted by MIT. Teams program software bots to compete 1-on-1 against other teams. Each year a new game is developed. We'll be doing our own little tournament locally.

### Getting Started

One of the trickiest parts of doing a BattleCode project can be getting the development environment setup. The code is done in Java and requires the much aged Java 8.  Follow along with the [gettting started](https://play.battlecode.org/getting-started) instructions on the BattleCode site and have patience with yourself as you get moving. Find your classmates that are running the same OS as you and work through bugs with them.

#### Where To Get Your BattleCode Code

Part of the BattleCode setup process points your towards the offical scaffold repo. We'll be doing something a bit different.  You will receive an email with a link to a BattleCode repo created from that scaffold. You should fork that repository and work from your fork. This mean:
1. Fork the Class BattleCode repo on Github
2. Clone your personal fork to your local machine.
3. Test your setup. Profit?

*When we get going in earnest, your team will choose one member's fork to act as the main repository for the team. All other team members should be given maintainer access to that repository on Github.*

### Projecting with Battlecode
