For our first project we'll be taking a crack at [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/), specifically the [2022 Variation](https://play.battlecode.org/home). Battlecode is an annual programming tournament hosted by MIT. Teams program software bots to compete 1-on-1 against other teams. Each year a new game is developed. We'll be doing our own little tournament locally.

### Getting Started

One of the trickiest parts of doing a BattleCode project can be getting the development environment setup. The code is done in Java and requires the much aged Java 8.  Follow along with the [gettting started](https://play.battlecode.org/getting-started) instructions on the BattleCode site and have patience with yourself as you get moving. Find your classmates that are running the same OS as you and work through bugs with them.

### Projecting with Battlecode

**Coming Soon!**
