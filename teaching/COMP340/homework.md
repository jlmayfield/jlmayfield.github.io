Below is the master list of the homework assignments. Work should be submitted
on an individual basis. You can work with classmates, but be sure you keep it honest. Help one another
understand problems and their solutions and do not simply give away solutions
without understanding. You should never be copying solutions from someone else. **Homework submission will be done on GradeScope. Graded material will be returned through GradeScope.**
