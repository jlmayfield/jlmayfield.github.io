Below is the master list of the programming/interview challenge problems. Unless it indicates
otherwise, you should *choose one problem from the list*. Not all problems will be presented
to the class. When they are, it will be indicated on the list below.

Work should be submitted on an individual basis. You can work with classmates, but be sure you keep it honest. Help one another understand problems and their solutions and do not simply give away solutions
without understanding. You should never be copying solutions from someone else.
