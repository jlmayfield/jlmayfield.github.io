Below you'll find links to the problems followed by directions.
*Be sure to read the directions as you may be called upon to
do something different than what's stated in the linked problem*.  The complete
set of problems for the textbook can always be found [here](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/).

## The Instructions

* **Chapter 1, Problems 18 & 19**  You do not need to do these problems directly as stated. Problems 18 and 19 ask you to explore things current AI can and cannot do.  You can investigate the tasks given or research some other tasks that interest you. *Just have examples of what AI can and cannot currently do and be ready to share your findings with the class!*
* **Chapter 1, Problem 20** Same as above, you do not need to follow the directions to the letter. The goal is to investigate a few (2-5) *grand challenges*, be ready to share them with the class, and be ready to discuss the two posed questions relative to your grand challenges.
* **Chapter 2, Exercises 4,5,8, & 10** Do these as stated. We'll probably spend at least a little class time starting these in small groups.
* **Chapter 2, Exercises 11 - 16** We're not actually doing the programming here, but will definitely discuss the problems and study the python solutions for these problems that can be found in the [AIMA Python Code Repo](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python). With that in mind, you should *clone the AIMA code repo and install it using the instructions found at the repo*.  You might not need it now, but we'll probably borrow from it and study from it throughout the semester.
