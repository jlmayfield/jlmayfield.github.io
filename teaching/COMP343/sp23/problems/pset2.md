Below you'll find links to the problems followed by directions.
*Be sure to read the directions as you may be called upon to
do something different than what's stated in the linked problem*.  The complete
set of problems for the textbook can always be found [here](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/).

## The Problems

  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 2](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_2/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 3](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_3/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 6](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_6/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 11](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_11/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 15](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_15/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 18](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_18/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 24](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_24/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 32](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_1/)
  * [Chapter 3, Exercise 40](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/search-exercises/ex_40/)

## Directions

  * Complete 2, 3, 15, 18, and 32 as directed by the problem.
  * For 24, you are not required to implement an agent and gather experimental data, but should do as rigorous as analysis of agent performance as you can manage.
  * Problems 6 and 40 look at the 8-Puzzle.  We'll be turning this into our first program! For the purposes of our problem set, you should look carefully at the linked papers and start sketching out some python to manage the 8-puzzle environment as well as a general search-based agent.
