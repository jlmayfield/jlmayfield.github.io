Below you'll find links to the problems followed by directions.
*Be sure to read the directions as you may be called upon to
do something different than what's stated in the linked problem*.  The complete
set of problems for the textbook can always be found [here](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/).

## The Problems

Chapter 12 in our edition of the text was chapter 13 in the previous edition. The online problem sets seem not to have been updated. Hence all these problems being attributed to chapter 13. :confused:

  * [13.9](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_9/)
  * [13.11](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_11/)
  * [13.13](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_13/)
  * [13.16](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_16/)
  * [13.17](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_17/)
  * [13.19](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_19/)
  * [13.22](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_22/)
  * [13.26](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_26/)
  * [13.28](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/probability-exercises/ex_28/)

## Directions

  * On 13.9, the second two Probabilities are conditional, namely *(Cavity  &#124;  catch)* and *(Cavity  &#124;  toothache V catch )*.  Pay attention to notation here. Capital letter names refer to variables where lower case names refer to specific values. Also, notice that you're being asked for distributions/vectors (bold **P** not P) and not individual probabilities. The joint distribution is Fig 12.3 in our text.
