title: COMP343 - Problem Set 9

This problem set is not really a problem set. It's pointers to some major milestones in AI, and game-playing AI in particular, that are directly related to the algorithms you're implementing for TicTacToe. There's nothing to turn-in here, but don't skip on these assignments as they show you just how far these algorithms can go. 

## DeepBlue 

We've already seen a short film about Deep Blue.  At the start of the semester you were given a paper titled *Deep Blue* (see syllabus).  Give this paper a quick read. Spend a little extra time on the following sections as they touch on the parts of the system most closely related to your tic-tac-toe studies:

*   Sections 1-2 - History and System overview.  
*   Section 4 - Software Search details
*   Section 7 - Evaluation Function

## Chinook

We'll start the Relatively Prime podcast episode titled [*Chinook*](https://relprime.com/chinook/) in class. *Finish it* and learn about the process of going from playing checkers to solving checkers. Then, give the paper *Checkers is Solved* a quick read to get some of the technical details of the proof; it uses AI search.  You're *strongly solving* tic-tac-toe, but most games are too complex for such a result. Checkers is one of the most complex games that has been at least *weakly solved*.
