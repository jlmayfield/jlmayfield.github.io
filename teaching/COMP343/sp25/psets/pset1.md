## Research and Exploration 

[Exercise 18](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/intro-exercises/ex_18/) asks you to hit the web and find out about the current state of the art AI for specific tasks.  You do not need to look into this list specifically, but should pick one or two tasks that are of particular interest to you and research those. You'll be doing a research survey at the end of the semester; this is task will, ideally, kick start that process.
