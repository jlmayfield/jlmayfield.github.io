Below is a master list of the lab assignments. Like with homework, they will be posted
and submitted on replit. Labs will typically be done in pairs. Every 30 minutes or every
problem, whichever comes first, pairs should switch who is driving and who is navigating.
Recall that the driver is typing code and generally doing to programming while the navigator
is looking for bugs and offering thoughts on overall design.
