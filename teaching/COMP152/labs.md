Below is a master list of the lab assignments. Labs are to be done in pairs. Every 30 minutes or every problem, whichever comes first, pairs should switch who is driving and who is navigating. Recall that the driver is typing code and generally doing to programming while the navigator is looking for bugs and offering thoughts on overall design.

Be certain that everyone's name is on the top of the document and submit the source code at the end of lab or when you complete the assigned problems.
