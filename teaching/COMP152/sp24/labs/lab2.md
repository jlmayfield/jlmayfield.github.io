The goal of this lab is twofold:
1.  Figure out how to use Github Classroom to manage assignments.
2.  Check-in with Python

## Getting Start on Git

**Coming Soon**

## Check-in Problems

Do not see these problems as a test of what you should know. The programming needed for these  should be familiar to you. That doesn't mean you're adept at using that code. It just means you have a working knowledge of the python needed to solve these problems. Our goal here is to check-in with where we're at and see what we need to spend more time with moving forward. 

From Chapter 1:
*   R1.1
*   R1.2
*   R1.4
*   R1.6
*   (Optional) For a challenge on new stuff check out R1.5 and R1.7
*   C1.14
*   C1.22
*   C1.24
