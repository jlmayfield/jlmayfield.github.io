### Lab 

The lab assignment for today is to carry out problems **R-3.23 to R-3.27** from the textbook.  Do not give only the Big-O characterization. Justify your reasoning. You will work in groups, but every person should turn in their answers and justifications. *Be prepared to present and explain your answer to the class on Friday*.

### Time Permitting

When you complete and submit your lab, then use the time remaining to work on the [chapter 3 homework](/teaching/COMP152/sp24/hwk/hwk1)
