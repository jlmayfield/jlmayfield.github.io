In this lab we'll explore using Python's classes to create our own data structures. We'll begin with problem **R-2.4** from chapter 2. We'll then extend that problem with new class methods and functions that work with our new data structure and lists of our new structure.  *More details coming soon. For the eager, be sure to read section 2.3 from the text*
