Complete the following problems from the book. This is a paper assignment: no code, no Github Classroom. Focus on core problem; they more closely align to test-like material. Make at least a good honest effort at the challenges and optional problem; they will deepen your understanding and appreciation of what's going on in the core problems. 

The python `math` module gives you log base 2, floor (round down) and ceiling (round up).  You can use them as seen below:
```python
from math import log2,floor,ceil

print(floor(log2(15)),log2(15),ceil(log2(15)))
```
Feel free to use python to help find/solve problems involving logarithms, especially those involving n*log(n).

* Core Problems - **Do First**
    *   R3.6
    *   R3.8
    *   R3.28 (the nlog(n) line is most easily done by writing code come back to it after finishing the rest of the core problems. the rest are computable with calculators)
    *   C3.36 (check out 3.3.3 for algorithm design/analysis "tricks")
    *   C3.44a
* Math Challenges 
    *   R3.2
    *   R3.3
    *   C3.38
    *   C3.44b
*   (Optional) For a fun puzzle, check out 3.53.
