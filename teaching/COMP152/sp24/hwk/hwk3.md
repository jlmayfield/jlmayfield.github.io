#### Assignment 

These instructions are also posted in the assignment README. There are four required problems and one optional/bonus problem. 
*   **Required**
    *   R-5.6  -- See arrayProbs.py
    *   C-5.15 (modified from book!) -- See arrayProbs.py
    *   C-5.16 -- See arrayProbs.py
    *   C-5.22 -- See otherProbs.py
*   **Optional**
    *   C-5.21 -- See otherProbs.py

You will be modifying and adding to the code in dynamic_array.py, but be certain you only add and modify the methods discussed in the problems.  So, start by looking at the book problems and then check out arrayProbs.py or otherProbs.py as indicated above. It should then be clear what you need to do to dynamic_array.py. If not, please ask for help and clarification.
