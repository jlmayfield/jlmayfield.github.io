The mystery language assignments let you explore the design space of languages.
You're given a set of languages, the features in that language, and it's syntax.
You need to figure out where and how the languages differ then *devise a set of*
**classifier** tests that distinguish the languages from one another.  Everything
you need to complete the assignments can be found of the [Mystery Language github
site](https://github.com/shriram/mystery-languages).  Once you've got the Mystery
Language package installed in Dr.Racket, [watch this video](https://youtu.be/EogblZ1Rdpo). Then read the [documentation](https://github.com/shriram/mystery-languages#the-languages) that follows on the github readme for the language you're to study. Here are direct links to
each lanauge:
