### Office Hours

This calendar tracks scheduled work appointments like classes, labs, and meetings. If I'm not busy at a particular time it just means I don't have something scheduled then. I still might be off campus or not in the office.

If you'd like to meet with me, then find a few meeting time options that work for you are open on my calendar and email me those options. I'll pick one and book it on this calendar.
