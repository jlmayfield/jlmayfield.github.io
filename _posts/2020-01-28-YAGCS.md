There are a lot of good guides to git out there.  I'll probably take a stab at writing one of my own for my students in the near future, but, for now, I'll just offer up [my git cheat sheet](/teaching/gitcheatsheet.pdf).  I'll keep cleaning it up and updating it over time. If you're looking for more than a command reference, then I recommend the excellent, and free, book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
